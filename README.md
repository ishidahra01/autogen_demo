# AutoGen Sample and Demo Code Repository

Welcome to the AutoGen Sample and Demo Code Repository! This repository contains example and demonstration code showcasing the capabilities of AutoGen, an open-source framework developed by Microsoft. AutoGen is designed to simplify the process of developing autonomous systems and AI-driven applications, allowing developers to harness state-of-the-art technologies efficiently.

## What is AutoGen?
AutoGen is an open-source framework by Microsoft aimed at enabling seamless development of autonomous systems and AI workflows. It offers tools and utilities to integrate generative AI models, orchestrate multi-agent interactions, and build intelligent systems with ease.

**Key features include:**
- AutoGen enables building next-gen LLM applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.
- It supports diverse conversation patterns for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning conversation autonomy, the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.
- It provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These systems span a wide range of applications from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns.
